    "You are provided with the PimaTraining.csv and PimaTest.csv. PimaTraining.csv contains some information for predicting the onset of diabetes within 5 years in Pima Indians given by medical details. PimaTest is missing the last column (classification data).\n",

    "It's a binary classification problem. There are some missing values, thought to be encoded with a 0. The variables are the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Number of times pregnant.\n",
    "2. Plasma glucose concentration a 2 hours in an oral glucose tolerance test.\n",
    "3. Diastolic blood pressure (mm Hg).\n",
    "4. Triceps skinfold thickness (mm).\n",
    "5. 2-Hour serum insulin (mu U/ml).\n",
    "6. Body mass index (weight in kg/(height in m)^2).\n",
    "7. Diabetes pedigree function.\n",
    "8. Age (years).\n",

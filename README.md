A composition of previous work, tools, and algorithms 

##Objective: 
to demonstate my strong, individual programming skills and understanding.


DISCLAIMER: lists and code guided by chatGPT.
(EG>)
give me a list of machine learning projects that every ML engineer should know

1. Image Recognition: Building a model to recognize and classify objects in images.
2. Natural Language Processing: Building models to process and generate natural language.
3. Time Series Forecasting: Building models to predict future values in a time series.
4. Recommendation Systems: Building models to generate personalized recommendations.
5. Text Classification: Building models to classify text into different categories.
6. Anomaly Detection: Building models to identify anomalies in data.
7. Reinforcement Learning: Building models to learn from interactions with an environment.
8. Speech Recognition: Building models to recognize and interpret speech.
9. Generative Models: Building models to generate new data from existing data.
10. Object Detection: Building models to detect and localize objects in images.

What does it take to be prepared to be a Machine Learning Engineer? 
   -   understanding of the various approaches in ML based on data input and objective. 
   -   Capability to combine methods into ML systems.
